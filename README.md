# Links for Brian Roach

Welcome to my link in bio page on links.dev! This page is based on the [my-links repository](https://github.com/linksdotdev/my-links) by [links.dev](https://links.dev). It contains links to my various online profiles and pages, including LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, and more.

## Customization

- Once you have created/updated your page.json and custom.css files, you can view your link in bio page by visiting the
  URL for your forked repo. For example, if your username is "fatih", the URL for your link in bio page would
  be https://links.dev/fatih

- If you want to invalidate the cache after you update your page, hit your page with refresh parameter, like
  this: https://links.dev/fatih?refresh=1

I will be updating this page regularly with new links and updates. Please check back often to see what's new!

If you would like to create your own link in bio page, you can use the [my-links repository](https://github.com/linksdotdev/my-links) as a starting point. Simply fork the repository to your own account and customize the page to your liking. Then, share your Link in Bio URL with potential employers, clients, and followers to make it easier for them to find and access all your important links in one place.
